FLOW

Correct Flow (Beginner-friendly)

1.HTML

Takes input from the user (form, buttons, input fields)

2.JavaScript (Frontend)

Reads data from HTML

Sends data to Backend using fetch() / AJAX

3.Backend (Flask / Server)

Receives request from JavaScript

Processes data (database logic, validation, CRUD)

Sends response back in JSON format

4.JavaScript (Frontend)

Receives JSON response from backend

Updates HTML (table, text, alerts, UI changes)

5.User

Sees updated result on the screen

JS (browser)  →  HTTP Request  →  Flask
JS (browser)  ←  JSON Response ←  Flask
